# TorlessCore

![.NET](https://github.com/PartTimeLegend/TorlessCore/workflows/.NET/badge.svg?branch=master) ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/PartTimeLegend/TorlessCore)

This is a library designed to be able to be included via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TorlessCore/) which allows you to check if an IP address is a known Tor Exit Node.

The package available here may work, it may not. I recommend you use the official nuget package source and install as follows.

## Install

### Package Manager

```powershell
Install-Package TorlessCore 
```

### .NET CLI

```powershell
dotnet add package TorlessCore
```

### PackageReference

```xml
<PackageReference Include="TorlessCore" Version="0.1.504110160" />
```
