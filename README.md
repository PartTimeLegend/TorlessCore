# TorlessCore

![.NET](https://github.com/PartTimeLegend/TorlessCore/workflows/.NET/badge.svg?branch=master)

This is a library designed to be able to be included via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TorlessCore/) which allows you to check if an IP address is a known Tor Exit Node.

The package available here may work, it may not. I recommend you use the official nuget package source and install as follows.
